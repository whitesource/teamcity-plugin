Teamcity Plugin
===================

An [external update agent][1] for [Jetbrains TeamCity][2] CI tool.

### Overview 

The plugin brings automatic open source management to TeamCity users.
Once set up, all usage of open source software in the organization will be continuously and automatically in sync with White Source.

* New projects will be created
* Existing projects will be updated
* Policies will be enforced on every action, failing the build if necessary.

Check the [online documentation][3] for instructions and screencasts on how to use the plugin.
Technical information about the plugin could be found [here][6].
